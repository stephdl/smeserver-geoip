=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin uses MaxMind's GeoIP service and the Geo::IP perl module to
do a lookup on incoming connections and, if necessary, block the country 
of origin.

Since the COUNTRY DB is local, the lookups are very fast.

If the country is on the 'badcountries' list from the system config db,
it returns a DENY, killing the connection without response.

=head1 CONFIG

config/badcountries

Each line is:
- a country code
  e.g. BR
       KR

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

If someone is in a 'badcountry,' emails won't come through. 

=head1 AUTHOR

Based on ident/geoip plugin from the qpsmtpd distribution.
